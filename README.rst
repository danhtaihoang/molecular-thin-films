Re-orientation transition in molecular thin films: Potts model with dipolar interaction
=============================================================================================

Abstract
-----------------------------
We study the low-temperature behavior and the phase transition of a thin film by Monte Carlo
simulation. The thin film has a simple cubic lattice structure where each site is occupied by a
Potts parameter which indicates the molecular orientation of the site. We take only three
molecular orientations in this paper, which correspond to the three-state Potts model. The
Hamiltonian of the system includes (i) the exchange interaction J ij between nearest-neighbor
sites i and j, (ii) the long-range dipolar interaction of amplitude D truncated at a cutoff
distance rc , and (iii) a single-ion perpendicular anisotropy of amplitude A. We allow Jij = Js
between surface spins, and Jij = J otherwise. We show that the ground state depends on the
ratio D/A and rc . For a single layer, for a given A, there is a critical value D c below (above)
which the ground-state (GS) configuration of molecular axes is perpendicular (parallel) to the
film surface. When the temperature T is increased, a re-orientation transition occurs near Dc:
the low-T in-plane ordering undergoes a transition to the perpendicular ordering at a finite T,
below the transition to the paramagnetic phase. The same phenomenon is observed in the case
of a film with a thickness. Comparison with the Fe/Gd experiment is given. We show that the
surface phase transition can occur below or above the bulk transition depending on the ratio
Js/J. Surface and bulk order parameters as well as other physical quantities are shown and
discussed.
